Cisco 3650, 3850, catalyst 9300 Switch password recovery
• Press "Mode" button as soon as the SYST light starts flashing green and you get switch into "switch:" mode.
switch: flash_init
switch: SWITCH_IGNORE_STARTUP_CFG=1
switch: boot
• From Switch> prompt, enter Enable mode (switch#) and then copy startup-config to running-config.. NOT run to start like you usually do, or you'll loose your configuration!
switch# copy startup-config running-config
• Fix the password or login issue you're having and save config.
• Now reboot the switch, get back into switch: mode, and fix the boot variable back to Zero.
switch: flash_init
switch: SWITCH_IGNORE_STARTUP_CFG=0
switch: boot

Alternatively to going back into the switch: prompt, some software versions also support the configuration command:
(config)#no system ignore startupconfig switch all
(config)#end
#write mem
Perform a reload and check the switch


Cisco Router IOS password recovery
• Use the Ctrl + Break function to get the router into Rommon as soon as router is power-cycled.
• Change the config-register variable to 0x2142 so the router will ignore the startup config in NVRAM, and then reboot the router.
monitor: command "boot" aborted due to user interrupt
rommon 1 >
rommon 1 > confreg 0x2142
• You must reset or power cycle for new config to take effect
rommon 2 > reset
• Router will boot without a config.  From the Router> prompt, enter Enable mode, and then copy startup config to running config.
Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog? [yes/no]: no

Press RETURN to get started!

• Now fix your password or login issue, save the config and reboot... then get router back into Rommon and set config-register to 0x2102
monitor: command "boot" aborted due to user interrupt
rommon 1 > confreg 0x2102

You must reset or power cycle for new config to take effect
rommon 2 > reset

Router will then reboot and load the saved config,  and now you'll be able to get into it this time, because you'll have fixed your password or login issue!
